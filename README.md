# Traffic Data Using Swarm Drones
This is project about a city traffic department who wants to collect traffic data using swarm UAVs (drones) from a number of locations in the city 
and use the data collected for improving traffic flow in the city and for a number of other undisclosed projects. 

I am responsible for creating a scalable data warehouse that will host the vehicle trajectory data extracted by analysing footage taken by swarm drones and static roadside cameras.
